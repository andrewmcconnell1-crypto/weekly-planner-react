-- Household sharing
-- =================
-- Lets two (or more) people who each have their own login share one planner:
-- the same meals, shopping list and stock. Run this once in the Supabase SQL
-- editor (Dashboard -> SQL -> New query -> paste -> Run).
--
-- Model: a "household" is identified by its owner's user id — the user whose
-- existing `app_data` row holds the shared data. `household_members` maps each
-- user to the household they belong to (their own id when they're solo). All
-- the cross-user work happens in SECURITY DEFINER functions so the row-level
-- security policies stay simple and non-recursive.
--
-- This migration is ADDITIVE: it does not drop or change your existing
-- `app_data` policies, so accounts that never join a household keep working
-- exactly as before.
